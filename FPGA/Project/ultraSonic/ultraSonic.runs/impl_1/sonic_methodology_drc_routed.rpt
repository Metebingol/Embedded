HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) JA[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (JA[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) JA[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (JA[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell value[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) countForEcho_reg[0]/CLR, countForEcho_reg[10]/CLR,
countForEcho_reg[11]/CLR, countForEcho_reg[12]/CLR,
countForEcho_reg[13]/CLR, countForEcho_reg[14]/CLR,

Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin i_clock/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive.

Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin i_clock/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive.
